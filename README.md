# Hello there!

This project was created as my capstone project for Code:You!

I have a fun background in music, as I got my undergraduate degree from Eastern
Kentucky University in music industry. Because of this background, I am always 
interested in the current trends in music and what makes songs popular.

This is a question I hope to answer with this project! I will be comparing
data from 2 data sets - one has songs from the Billboard Top 100 list, and
the other has data that tracks several data points of over 1800 songs from
Spotify. My goal is to compare the songs that are on both of the lists, and 
use the data from the Spotify Tracks to see what makes a hit? Is it how
danceable the song is, the energy of the song, how loud it is? Here is to seeing
if we will find what makes a hit!

## This project utilizes a virtual environment. 
### Here is how you use it:

1a - Clone this repository.
(or)
1b - Open the repository and download as a ZIP file, and extract it to your desired folder.

2 - Open the file with VSCode in the project folder.

3 - Create a virtual environment.

GitBash

    python -m venv venv

Mac/Linux

    python3 -m venv venv

4 - Activate the existing virtual environment with this:

GitBash

    venv\Scripts\activate

Mac/Linux

    source venv/bin/activate

5 - Install the requirements package.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

You don't have to install the requirements package!
You can just do the following:

    pip install pandas
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install numpy
    pip install mplcursors
    pip install plotly


6 - Select the virtual environment.
Open the Command Pallette (CTRL+Shift+P)/(Cmd+Shift+P) on Mac.
Type "Python: Select interpreter".
Select the one that starts with venv.

PlLEASE NOTE! - You may get a window saying you need to install a kernel to use the notebook. Please download it in order to use the notebook!
