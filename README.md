# Hello!

This project was created as my capstone project for Code:You!

I have a fune background in music, as I got my undergraduate degree from Eastern
Kentucky University in music industry. Because of this background, I am always 
intrested in the current trends in music and what makes songs popular.

This is a question I hope to answer with this project! I will be comparing
data from 2 data sets - one has songs from the Billboard Top 100 list, and
the other has data that tracks several data points of over 1800 songs from
Spotify. My goal is to compare the songs that are on both of the lists, and 
use the data from the Spotify Tracks to see what makes a hit? Is it how
dancable the song is, the energy of the song, how loud it is? Here is to seeing
if we will find what
