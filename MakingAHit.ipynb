With this in mind, it lead me to make the next plot!\n",

While energy and danceability did not cross each other, valence did cross with both of them fairly close, within 0.1 of each other on the scale. This further leads me to believing that there is a strong correlation between these 3 things and what makes a song popular. However, there are still 3 more plots I made.\n",

The first boxplot contains the information for danceability, energy, valence, acousticness, and valence, and the second boxplot was only tempo. The first thing I noticed was just how many outliers there was for speechiness. Statistically speaking, usually, when data has a lot of outliers, it has to do with the amount of data being calculated and how much the data deviated from the general pattern, which can skew the analysis done by the plot. Because of the amount of outliers, this is the reason I decided to do a histogram for the final plot, but we'll get to that in a minute. Looking at the rest of the data on the boxplots, danceabiliy, energy, and valence do have a lot of overlap with each other, and the upper quartile value of the acousticness plot seems to just overlap with those. The tempo boxplot seems to have 100 bpm to 140 bmp as a good tempo range, which seems about right to me as a musician.\n",

    "The final plot shows the histograms for all 6 of the columns in question. For danceability, a good range to focus on is 0.5 to 0.7. For energy, since there seems to be a like for higher-energy songs, a good range to look at seems to be between 0.7 to 0.9. For speechiness, it seems that it drops off at 0.45, so I'm just going to go ahead and call the range for that 0.0 to 0.45. For acousticness, a good range seems to be between 0.0 and 0.4. Valence has an interesting histogram as it seems a little bumpy, but a good range seems between 0.4 to 0.8. For tempo, like in the boxplot, a good range seems to be in the 100bmp to 140bmp range. "
